# myFirstPythonProject

## The main objectives of the project
The project's idea is to learn various design and implementation methods such as OOP, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It does not to provide a specific application. In particular, the project is designed to explore OOP design's capabilities. 
However, to explore these programming concepts, an e-retails system for a toy shop is used. Note that the project is designed to explore the code rather than the application of it. For this reason, no effort has been made for the user interface design and for any additional functionality.

### Requirements of the System: 

•	ability to browse products. <br />
•	ability to search for products. <br /> 
•	ability to review products. <br />

### Functional Requirements of the system:

•	Code should be done in a OOP fashion.  <br />
•	Code should contain a connection to the database.  <br />
•	Code should contain a simple user interface (No design required) <br />
